In this project we try to see which free agent players are the best fit for the Toronto Raptors roster according to the team's weaknesses.

To do this we did a data cleaning in Python and classify the data of all players, such as free players with the highest number of points, rebounds, etc..

When passing the data to Power BI and for a correct visualization we have created some DAX measures for further filtration such as players under 25 years old.

In the last page there is a conclusion of which would be the best options according to the numbers.
